			The pictures above is a group picture of them since they debuted, from 2013-2018. They grew as a group and also as individuals. They faced all the trials, they had as a group, and became stronger together. They are really close like family, they do fight and argue, but at the end of the day, they have a strong bond together. They also did not give up on each other, when they had the option to disband and ARMY and the BTS have a strong relationship and we both know that we got each others back. BTS always like to credit army in everything and every award that they achieve.BTS as a group has a humble nature, and that's one of the reason, why army has BTS backs.</p>

			
			<p>ARMY is the name for BTS fandom. Army stands for Adorable Representative MC for the youths.Army always support and represent BTS in all they do. ARMY means the military in english, so the body armour(BTS) and military(ARMY) are always together.</p>
